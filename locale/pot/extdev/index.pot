msgid "This is what you can do in an extension: First, you can add new :term:`builder`\\s to support new output formats or actions on the parsed documents.  Then, it is possible to register custom reStructuredText roles and directives, extending the markup.  And finally, there are so-called \"hook points\" at strategic places throughout the build process, where an extension can register a hook and run specialized code."

msgid "An extension is simply a Python module.  When an extension is loaded, Sphinx imports this module and executes its ``setup()`` function, which in turn notifies Sphinx of everything the extension offers -- see the extension tutorial for examples."
