msgid "This is the documentation for the Sphinx documentation builder.  Sphinx is a tool that translates a set of reStructuredText_ source files into various output formats, automatically producing cross-references, indices etc.  That is, if you have a directory containing a bunch of reST-formatted documents (and possibly subdirectories of docs in there as well), Sphinx can generate a nicely-organized arrangement of HTML files (in some other directory) for easy browsing and navigation.  But from the same source, it can also generate a LaTeX file that you can compile into a PDF version of the documents, or a PDF file directly using `rst2pdf <http://rst2pdf.googlecode.com>`_."

msgid "The focus is on hand-written documentation, rather than auto-generated API docs. Though there is support for that kind of docs as well (which is intended to be freely mixed with hand-written content), if you need pure API docs have a look at `Epydoc <http://epydoc.sf.net/>`_, which also understands reST."
