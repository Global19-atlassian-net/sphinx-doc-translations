"This extension is meant to help with the common pattern of having many "
"external links that point to URLs on one and the same site, e.g. links to "
"bug trackers, version control web interfaces, or simply subpages in other "
"websites.  It does so by providing aliases to base URLs, so that you only "
"need to give the subpage name when creating a link."

"Let's assume that you want to include many links to issues at the Sphinx "
"tracker, at :samp:`http://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/{num}`.  "
"Typing this URL again and again is tedious, so you can use "
":mod:`~sphinx.ext.extlinks` to avoid repeating yourself."

"Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. ``:issue:`123```.  This "
"then inserts a link to https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/123. As "
"you can see, the target given in the role is substituted in the base URL in "
"the place of ``%s``."
