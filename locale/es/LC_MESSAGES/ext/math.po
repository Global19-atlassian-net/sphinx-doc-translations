msgid ""
"Since mathematical notation isn't natively supported by HTML in any way, "
"Sphinx supports math in documentation with several extensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:14
msgid ""
"The basic math support is contained in :mod:`sphinx.ext.mathbase`. Other "
"math support extensions should, if possible, reuse that support too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:19
msgid ""
":mod:`.mathbase` is not meant to be added to the :confval:`extensions` "
"config value, instead, use either :mod:`sphinx.ext.pngmath` or "
":mod:`sphinx.ext.mathjax` as described below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:23
msgid ""
"The input language for mathematics is LaTeX markup.  This is the de-facto "
"standard for plain-text math notation and has the added advantage that no "
"further translation is necessary when building LaTeX output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:27
msgid ""
"Keep in mind that when you put math markup in **Python docstrings** read by "
":mod:`autodoc <sphinx.ext.autodoc>`, you either have to double all "
"backslashes, or use Python raw strings (``r\"raw\"``)."

"Directive for displayed math (math that takes the whole line for itself)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:43
msgid ""
"The directive supports multiple equations, which should be separated by a "
"blank line::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:52
msgid ""
"In addition, each single equation is set within a ``split`` environment, "
"which means that you can have multiple aligned lines in an equation, aligned"
" at ``&`` and separated by ``\\\\``::"

"For more details, look into the documentation of the `AmSMath LaTeX "
"package`_."

"When the math is only one line of text, it can also be given as a directive "
"argument::"

#: ../../ext/math.rst:69
msgid ""
"Normally, equations are not numbered.  If you want your equation to get a "
"number, use the ``label`` option.  When given, it selects an internal label "
"for the equation, by which it can be cross-referenced, and causes an "
"equation number to be issued.  See :rst:role:`eqref` for an example.  The "
"numbering style depends on the output format."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:75
msgid ""
"There is also an option ``nowrap`` that prevents any wrapping of the given "
"math in a math environment.  When you give this option, you must make sure "
"yourself that the math is properly set up.  For example::"

msgid ":mod:`sphinx.ext.pngmath` -- Render math as PNG images"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:105
msgid ""
"This extension renders math via LaTeX and dvipng_ into PNG images.  This of "
"course means that the computer where the docs are built must have both "
"programs available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:109
msgid ""
"There are various config values you can set to influence how the images are "
"built:"

msgid ""
"The command name with which to invoke LaTeX.  The default is ``'latex'``; "
"you may need to set this to a full path if ``latex`` is not in the "
"executable search path."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:118
msgid ""
"Since this setting is not portable from system to system, it is normally not"
" useful to set it in ``conf.py``; rather, giving it on the :program:`sphinx-"
"build` command line via the :option:`-D <sphinx-build -D>` option should be "
"preferable, like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:125
msgid ""
"This value should only contain the path to the latex executable, not further"
" arguments; use :confval:`pngmath_latex_args` for that purpose."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:131
msgid ""
"The command name with which to invoke ``dvipng``.  The default is "
"``'dvipng'``; you may need to set this to a full path if ``dvipng`` is not "

"Additional LaTeX code to put into the preamble of the short LaTeX files that"

" e.g. to add more packages whose commands you want to use in the math."

#: ../../ext/math.rst:150
msgid ""
"Additional arguments to give to dvipng, as a list.  The default value is "
"``['-gamma', '1.5', '-D', '110', '-bg', 'Transparent']`` which makes the "
"image a bit darker and larger then it is by default, and produces PNGs with "
"a transparent background."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:155
msgid "Now includes ``-bg Transparent`` by default."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:160
msgid ""
"``dvipng`` has the ability to determine the \"depth\" of the rendered text: "
"for example, when typesetting a fraction inline, the baseline of surrounding"
" text should not be flush with the bottom of the image, rather the image "
"should extend a bit below the baseline.  This is what TeX calls \"depth\".  "
"When this is enabled, the images put into the HTML document will get a "
"``vertical-align`` style that correctly aligns the baselines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:167
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, this only works when the `preview-latex package`_ is "
"installed.  Therefore, the default for this option is ``False``."

"Default: ``True``.  If false, do not add the LaTeX code as an \"alt\" "

"This extension puts math as-is into the HTML files.  The JavaScript package "
"MathJax_ is then loaded and transforms the LaTeX markup to readable math "
"live in the browser."

"Because MathJax (and the necessary fonts) is very large, it is not included "
"in Sphinx."

msgid ""
"The path to the JavaScript file to include in the HTML files in order to "
"load MathJax."

#: ../../ext/math.rst:198
msgid ""
"The default is the ``http://`` URL that loads the JS files from the `MathJax"
" CDN <http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html>`_.  If you want MathJax "
"to be available offline, you have to download it and set this value to a "

msgid ""
"The path can be absolute or relative; if it is relative, it is relative to "
"the ``_static`` directory of the built docs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:206
msgid ""
"For example, if you put MathJax into the static path of the Sphinx docs, "
