"Usage is simple: whenever Sphinx encounters a cross-reference that has no "
"matching target in the current documentation set, it looks for targets in "
"the documentation sets configured in :confval:`intersphinx_mapping`.  A "

"documentation for the ZipFile class, without you having to specify where it "
