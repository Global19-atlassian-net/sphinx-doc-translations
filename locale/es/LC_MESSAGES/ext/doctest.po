msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/doctest.rst:14
msgid ""
"This extension allows you to test snippets in the documentation in a natural"
" way.  It works by collecting specially-marked up code blocks and running "
"them as doctest tests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/doctest.rst:18
msgid ""
"Within one document, test code is partitioned in *groups*, where each group "
"consists of:"

"When building the docs with the ``doctest`` builder, groups are collected "
"for each document and run one after the other, first executing setup code "
"blocks, then the test blocks in the order they appear in the file."

msgid "There are two kinds of test blocks:"

#: ../../ext/doctest.rst:30

"*doctest-style* blocks mimic interactive sessions by interleaving Python "
"code (including the interpreter prompt) and output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/doctest.rst:33

"*code-output-style* blocks consist of an ordinary piece of Python code, and "
"optionally, a piece of output for that code."

#: ../../ext/doctest.rst:36
msgid ""
"The doctest extension provides four directives.  The *group* argument is "
"interpreted as follows: if it is empty, the block is assigned to the group "
"named ``default``.  If it is ``*``, the block is assigned to all groups "
"(including the ``default`` group).  Otherwise, it must be a comma-separated "
"list of group names."

#: ../../ext/doctest.rst:58
msgid ""
"A doctest-style code block.  You can use standard :mod:`doctest` flags for "
"controlling how actual output is compared with what you give as output.  By "
"default, these options are enabled: ``ELLIPSIS`` (allowing you to put "
"ellipses in the expected output that match anything in the actual output), "
"``IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL`` (not comparing tracebacks), "
"``DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1`` (by default, doctest accepts \"True\" in the "
"output where \"1\" is given -- this is a relic of pre-Python 2.2 times)."

"``hide``, a flag option, hides the doctest block in other builders.  By "
"default it is shown as a highlighted doctest block."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/doctest.rst:71
msgid ""
"``options``, a string option, can be used to give a comma-separated list of "
"doctest flags that apply to each example in the tests.  (You still can give "
"explicit flags per example, with doctest comments, but they will show up in "
"other builders too.)"
