"Originally, Sphinx was conceived for a single project, the documentation of "
"the Python language.  Shortly afterwards, it was made available for everyone"
" as a documentation tool, but the documentation of Python modules remained "
"deeply built in -- the most fundamental directives, like ``function``, were "
"designed for Python objects.  Since Sphinx has become somewhat popular, "
"interest developed in using it for many different purposes: C/C++ projects, "
"JavaScript, or even reStructuredText markup (like in this documentation)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../domains.rst:21
msgid ""
"While this was always possible, it is now much easier to easily support "

"for every such purpose."

"A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText :term:`directive`\\ s "

" in a domain have names like ``domain:name``, e.g. ``py:function``.  Domains"

"Most domains provide a number of :dfn:`object description directives`, used "

"makes entries in the general index; if no index entry is desired, you can "
"give the directive option flag ``:noindex:``.  An example using a Python "
"domain directive::"
